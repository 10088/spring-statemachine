= State Machine Examples

This part of the reference documentation explains the use of state
machines as sample code together with a uml state charts. We do few
shortcuts when representing relationship between a state chart, SSM
configuration and what an application does with a state machine. For
complete examples go and study the samples repository.

== Turnstile

Turnstile is a simple device which gives you an access if payment is
made and is a very simple to model using a state machine. In its
simples form there are only two states, `LOCKED` and `UNLOCKED`. Two
events, `COIN` and `PUSH` can happen if you try to go through it or
you make a payment.

You can see how this sample state machine interacts with event by
running `turnstile` sample.
