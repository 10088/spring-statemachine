= State Machine Examples

This part of the reference documentation explains the use of state
machines as sample code together with a uml state charts. We do few
shortcuts when representing relationship between a state chart, SSM
configuration and what an application does with a state machine. For
complete examples go and study the samples repository.

== Turnstile

Turnstile is a simple device which gives you an access if payment is
made and is a very simple to model using a state machine. In its
simples form there are only two states, `LOCKED` and `UNLOCKED`. Two
events, `COIN` and `PUSH` can happen if you try to go through it or
you make a payment.

== Showcase
Showcase is a complex state machine showing all possible transition
topologies up to four levels of state nesting.

== CD Player
CD Player is a sample which resembles better use case of most of use have
used in a real world. CD Player itself is a really simple entity where
user can open a deck, inser or change a disk, then drive player
functionality by pressing various buttons like _eject_, _play_,
_stop_, _pause_, _rewind_ and _backward_.

How many of use have really given a thought of what it will take to
make a code for a CD Player which interacts with a hardware. Yes,
concept of a player is overly simple but if you look behind a scenes
things actually get a bit convoluted.

You've probably noticed that if your deck is open and you press play,
deck will close and a song will start to play if CD was inserted in
a first place. In a sense when deck is open you first need to close
it and then try to start playing if cd is actually instered. Hopefully
you have now realised that a simple CD Player is not anymore so simple.
Sure you can wrap all this with a simple class with few boolean variables
and probably few nested if/else clauses, that will do the job, but what
about if you need to make all this behaviour much more complex, do you
really want to keep adding more flags and if/else clauses.

Lets go throught how this sample and its state machine is designed and
how those two interacts with each other. Below three config sections
are used withing a _EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter_.

What we did in above configuration:

* We used EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter to configure states and
  transitions.
* States _CLOSED_ and _OPEN_ are defined as substates of _IDLE_,
  states _PLAYING_ and _PAUSED_ are defined as substates of _BUSY_.
* With state _CLOSED_ we added entry action as bean
  _closedEntryAction_.
* With transition we mostly mapped events to expected state
  transitions like _EJECT_ closing and opening a deck, _PLAY_, _STOP_
  and _PAUSE_ doing their natural transitions. Few words to mention
  what we did for other transitions.
** With source state _PLAYING_ we added a timer trigger which is
needed to automatically track elapsed time within a playing track and
to have facility to make a decision when to switch to next track.
** With event _PLAY_ if source state is _IDLE_ and target state is
  _BUSY_ we defined action _playAction_ and guard _playGuard_.
** With event _LOAD_ and state _OPEN_ we defined internal
transition with action _loadAction_ which will insert cd disc into
extended state variables.
** _PLAYING_ state defined three internal transitions where one is
triggered by a timer executing a _playingAction_ which updates
extended state variables. Other two transitions are with _trackAction_
with different events, _BACK_ and _FORWARD_ respectively which handles
when user wants to go back or forward in tracks.

This machine only have six states which are introduced as an enum.

Events represent, in a sense in this example, what buttons user would
press and if user loads a cd disc into a deck.

Beans _cdPlayer_ and _library_ are just used with a sample to drive
the application.

We can define extended state variable key as simple enums.

We wanted to make this samply type safe so we're defining our own
annotation _@StatesOnTransition_ which have a mandatory meta
annotation _@OnTransition_.

_ClosedEntryAction_ is a entry action for state _CLOSED_ to simply
send and _PLAY_ event to a statemachine if cd disc is present.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetG]
----

_LoadAction_ is simply updating extended state variable if event
headers contained information about a cd disc to load.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetH]
----

_PlayAction_ is simply resetting player elapsed time which is kept as
an extended state variable.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetI]
----

_PlayGuard_ is used to guard transition from _IDLE_ to _BUSY_ with
event _PLAY_ if extended state variable _CD_ doesn't indicate that cd
disc has been loaded.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetJ]

_PlayingAction_ is updating extended state variable _ELAPSEDTIME_ which
cd player itself can read and update lcd status. Action also handles
track shift if user is going back or forward in tracks.
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetK]
----

_TrackAction_ handles track shift action if user is going back or forward
in tracks. If it is a last track of a cd, playing is stopped and _STOP_
event sent to a state machine.
