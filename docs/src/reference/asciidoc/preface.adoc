== Preface
Concept of a state machine is most likely older that any of a reader
of this reference documentation and definitely older than a Java
language itself. Description of finite automate dates back to 1943
when gentlements Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts wrote a paper about
it. Later George H. Mealy presented a state machine concept in 1955
which is known as a Mealy Machine. A year later in 1956 Edward F.
Moore presented another paper which is known as a Moore Machine. If
you're ever read anything about state machines, names Mealy and Moore
should have popped up at some point.
